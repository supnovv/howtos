This section describes the basic concepts of the language.

## 2.1 Values and Types

Lua is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not have types; only values do.
There are no type definitions in the language. All values carry their own type.

All values in Lua are first-class values. This means that all values can be stored in variables, 
passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.

Lua是一种动态类型语言，其变量可以关联任何类型的值，所有值自己保存类型信息。
Lua中的所以值都是first-class值，即所有值都可以存储在变量中，用作函数参数，用作返回值。

There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function, userdata, thread, and table. 
The type nil has one single value, `nil`, whose main property is to be different from any other value; 
it usually represents the absence of a useful value. The type boolean has two values, `false` and `true`. 
Both `nil` and `false` make a condition false; any other value makes it true. 
The type number represents both integer numbers and real (floating-point) numbers. 
The type string represents immutable sequences of bytes.
Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros ('\0').
Lua is also encoding-agnostic; it makes no assumptions about the contents of a string.
