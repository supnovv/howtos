## 2.2 Environments and the Global Environment

As will be discussed in §3.2 and §3.3.3, any reference to a free name 
(that is, a name not bound to any declaration) `var` is syntactically translated to `_ENV.var`. 
Moreover, every chunk is compiled in the scope of an external local variable named `_ENV` (see §3.3.2), 
so `_ENV` itself is never a free name in a chunk.

Despite the existence of this external `_ENV` variable and the translation of free names, 
`_ENV` is a completely regular name. 
In particular, you can define new variables and parameters with that name. 
Each reference to a free name uses the `_ENV` that is visible at that point in the program, 
following the usual visibility rules of Lua (see §3.5).

Any table used as the value of `_ENV` is called an environment.

Lua keeps a distinguished environment called the global environment. 
This value is kept at a special index in the C registry (see §4.5). 
In Lua, the global variable `_G` is initialized with this same value. (`_G` is never used internally.)

When Lua loads a chunk, the default value for its `_ENV` upvalue is the global environment (see `load`). 
Therefore, by default, free names in Lua code refer to entries 
in the global environment (and, therefore, they are also called global variables). 
Moreover, all standard libraries are loaded in the global environment 
and some functions there operate on that environment. 
You can use `load` (or `loadfile`) to load a chunk with a different environment. 
(In C, you have to load the chunk and then change the value of its first upvalue.)
