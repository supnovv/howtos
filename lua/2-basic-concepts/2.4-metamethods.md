## 2.4 Metamethods

Every value in Lua can have a metatable. This metatable is an ordinary Lua table that defines 
the behavior of the original value under certain special operations.
You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over a value by setting specific fields in its metatable.

For instance, when a non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, 
Lua checks for a function in the field "__add" of the value's metatable. 
If it finds one, Lua calls this function to perform the addition.

The keys in a metatable are derived from the event names; the corresponding values are called metamethods. 
In the previous example, the event is "add" and the metamethod is the function that performs the addition.

Lua的值都可以有一个元表。元表是普通的表，定义了对应值在特定操作下的行为。
可以通过设定元表特定元素的值改变值操作的多种行为。
例如对非数值型数据执行加操作，Lua会寻找元表`__add`元素上的元函数，如果找到则调用这个函数执行加操作。
元表的键来源于事件名字，其对应的值称为元函数。
例如前面例子中，事件名字是"add"，执行加操作的函数是元函数。

You can query the metatable of any value using the `getmetatable` function.
You can replace the metatable of tables using the `setmetatable` function. 
You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua code (except by using the debug library (§6.10)); 
you must use the C API for that.

调用`getmetatable`可以查询元表中的值，也可以调用`setmetatable`函数替换表的元表。
在Lua代码中不能修改除表之外其他类型值的元表（除非使用调试库）；通过调用C API才能做到。

Tables and full userdata have individual metatables 
(although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables). 
Values of all other types share one single metatable per type; 
that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers, one for all strings, etc. 
By default, a value has no metatable, but the string library sets a metatable for the string type (see §6.4).

表和完全用户数据有独立的元表（然而多个表和用户数据可以共享它们的元表）。
所有其他类型的值根据类型共享同一个元表，即所有数值型数据共享同一个元表，所有字符串共享同一个元表，等等。
一个值默认是没有元表的，但是字符串库为字符串类型设置了一个元表（？？？见6.4）。

A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, order comparisons, 
concatenation, length operation, calls, and indexing. 
A metatable also can define a function to be called when a userdata or a table is garbage collected (§2.5).

元表控制对象如何进行算术运算、位运算、关系运算、连接、取长度、调用、索引等操作。
元表也用来定义函数在用户数据或表被垃圾回收时调用。

A detailed list of events controlled by metatables is given next. 
Each operation is identified by its corresponding event name. 
The key for each event is a string with its name prefixed by two underscores, '__'; 
for instance, the key for operation "add" is the string "__add". 
Note that queries for metamethods are always raw; the access to a metamethod does not invoke other metamethods.

For the unary operators (negation, length, and bitwise not), 
the metamethod is computed and called with a dummy second operand, equal to the first one. 
This extra operand is only to simplify Lua's internals (by making these operators behave like a binary operation) 
and may be removed in future versions. (For most uses this extra operand is irrelevant.) 

元表控制的详细事件列表如下。每个操作读用对应的事件名称标识。
事件对应的键是事件名称前添加两个下划线形成的字符串；例如`add`操作的键是字符串`__add`。
元函数的查询总是原始的；一个元函数的访问不会调用到其他的元函数（？？？）。
对于一元操作（取负、取长度、和位反），元函数的第二个参数是无效的。
这个无效的额外参数仅仅为了简化Lua的内部实现（使一元操作像二元操作一样），
可能在未来版本中移除（对绝大多数用户，这个额外参数没有什么影响）。

- **"add"**: the `+` operation. If any operand for an addition is not a number (nor a string coercible to a number), 
  Lua will try to call a metamethod. First, Lua will check the first operand (even if it is valid). 
  If that operand does not define a metamethod for the "__add" event, then Lua will check the second operand. 
  If Lua can find a metamethod, it calls the metamethod with the two operands as arguments, 
  and the result of the call (adjusted to one value) is the result of the operation. 
  Otherwise, it raises an error.

- **"sub"**: the - operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"mul"**: the * operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"div"**: the / operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"mod"**: the % operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"pow"**: the ^ (exponentiation) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"unm"**: the - (unary minus) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"idiv"**: the // (floor division) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

- **"band"**: the & (bitwise and) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, except that 
  Lua will try a metamethod if any operand is neither an integer nor a value coercible to an integer (see §3.4.3).

- **"bor"**: the | (bitwise or) operation. Behavior similar to the "band" operation.

- **"bxor"**: the ~ (bitwise exclusive or) operation. Behavior similar to the "band" operation.

- **"bnot"**: the ~ (bitwise unary not) operation. Behavior similar to the "band" operation.

- **"shl"**: the << (bitwise left shift) operation. Behavior similar to the "band" operation.

- **"shr"**: the >> (bitwise right shift) operation. Behavior similar to the "band" operation.

- **"concat"**: the .. (concatenation) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, except that 
  Lua will try a metamethod if any operand is neither a string nor a number (which is always coercible to a string).

- **"len"**: the # (length) operation. If the object is not a string, Lua will try its metamethod. 
  If there is a metamethod, Lua calls it with the object as argument, and the result of the call 
  (always adjusted to one value) is the result of the operation. If there is no metamethod but the object is a table, 
  then Lua uses the table length operation (see §3.4.7). Otherwise, Lua raises an error.

- **"eq"**: the == (equal) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, 
  except that Lua will try a metamethod only when the values being compared are either both tables or 
  both full userdata and they are not primitively equal. The result of the call is always converted to a boolean.

- **"lt"**: the < (less than) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, 
  except that Lua will try a metamethod only when the values being compared are neither both numbers nor both strings. 
  The result of the call is always converted to a boolean.

- **"le"**: the <= (less equal) operation. Unlike other operations, 
  the less-equal operation can use two different events. 
  First, Lua looks for the "__le" metamethod in both operands, like in the "lt" operation. 
  If it cannot find such a metamethod, then it will try the "__lt" event, 
  assuming that a <= b is equivalent to not (b < a). As with the other comparison operators, 
  the result is always a boolean. 
  (This use of the "__lt" event can be removed in future versions; it is also slower than a real "__le" metamethod.)

- **"index"**: The indexing access table[key]. This event happens when table is not a table or 
  when key is not present in table. The metamethod is looked up in table. 

  Despite the name, the metamethod for this event can be either a function or a table. 
  If it is a function, it is called with table and key as arguments. 
  If it is a table, the final result is the result of indexing this table with key. 
  (This indexing is regular, not raw, and therefore can trigger another metamethod.)

- **"newindex"**: The indexing assignment table[key] = value. 
  Like the index event, this event happens when table is not a table or when key is not present in table. 
  The metamethod is looked up in table.

  Like with indexing, the metamethod for this event can be either a function or a table. 
  If it is a function, it is called with table, key, and value as arguments. 
  If it is a table, Lua does an indexing assignment to this table with the same key and value. 
  (This assignment is regular, not raw, and therefore can trigger another metamethod.)

  Whenever there is a "newindex" metamethod, Lua does not perform the primitive assignment. 
  (If necessary, the metamethod itself can call rawset to do the assignment.)

- **"call"**: The call operation func(args). 
  This event happens when Lua tries to call a non-function value (that is, func is not a function). 
  The metamethod is looked up in func. If present, the metamethod is called with func as its first argument, 
  followed by the arguments of the original call (args).

It is a good practice to add all needed metamethods to a table before setting it as a metatable of some object. 
In particular, the "__gc" metamethod works only when this order is followed (see §2.5.1).
