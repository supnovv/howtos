## lua_next [-1, +(2|0), e]
```c
int lua_next (lua_State *L, int index);
```

Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a keyâ€“value pair from the table at the given index 
(the "next" pair after the given key). If there are no more elements in the table, 
then `lua_next` returns 0 (and pushes nothing).

A typical traversal looks like this:
```c
/* table is in the stack at index 't' */
lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */
while (lua_next(L, t) != 0) {
  /* uses 'key' (at index -2) and 'value' (at index -1) */
  printf("%s - %s\n",
    lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -2)),
    lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -1)));
  /* removes 'value'; keeps 'key' for next iteration */
  lua_pop(L, 1);
}
```
While traversing a table, do not call `lua_tolstring` directly on a key, 
unless you know that the key is actually a string. 
Recall that `lua_tolstring` may change the value at the given index; this confuses the next call to `lua_next`.

See function `next` for the caveats of modifying the table during its traversal.
