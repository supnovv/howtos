## 3.3 Statements

Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in Pascal or C. 
This set includes assignments, control structures, function calls, and variable declarations.

Lua支持大部分常用语句，跟Pascal和C相似。包括赋值、结构控制、函数调用、以及变量声明。

### 3.3.1 Blocks

A block is a list of statements, which are executed sequentially:
```
block ::= {stat}
```
Lua has empty statements that allow you to separate statements with semicolons, 
start a block with a semicolon or write two semicolons in sequence:
```
stat ::= ‘;’
```

语句块由多条语句组成，这些语句按顺序执行。
Lua中有空语句`;`，允许用来分隔语句、用在语句块开头、或连续写两个分号。

Function calls and assignments can start with an open parenthesis. 
This possibility leads to an ambiguity in Lua's grammar. 
Consider the following fragment:
```
a = b + c
(print or io.write)('done')
```
The grammar could see it in two ways:
```
a = b + c(print or io.write)('done')
a = b + c; (print or io.write)('done')
```
The current parser always sees such constructions in the first way, 
interpreting the open parenthesis as the start of the arguments to a call. 
To avoid this ambiguity, it is a good practice to always precede with a semicolon statements 
that start with a parenthesis:
```
;(print or io.write)('done')
```

函数调用和赋值语句可以用开始括号`(`开头，如果这个开始括号`(`单独成行，则有可能引起歧义，如上。
为避免这种混淆，好的做法是总在开始括号`(`前加上分号。

A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:
```
stat ::= do block end
```
Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations. 
Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a `return` statement in the middle of another block (see §3.3.4). 

可以用`do`和`end`定义显示语句块，使用显示语句块可以方便的控制变量的作用域。
显示语句块也用于在其他语句块中间插入`return`语句。

### 3.3.2 Chunks

The unit of compilation of Lua is called a chunk. 
Syntactically, a chunk is simply a block:
```
chunk ::= block
```
Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable number of arguments (see §3.4.11). 
As such, chunks can define local variables, receive arguments, and return values. 
Moreover, such anonymous function is compiled as in the scope of an external local variable called `_ENV` (see §2.2).
The resulting function always has `_ENV` as its only upvalue, even if it does not use that variable.

A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. 
To execute a chunk, Lua first loads it, precompiling the chunk's code into instructions for a virtual machine, 
and then Lua executes the compiled code with an interpreter for the virtual machine.

Chunks can also be precompiled into binary form; see program `luac` and function `string.dump` for details. 
Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; 
Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly (see `load`). 

Lua的编译单元称为chunk块，其语法上是一语句块。
Lua将chunk处理为带变长参数的匿名函数语句块，因而chunk内可以定义局部变量、接收参数、返回返回值。
