# 3. The Language

This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua. 
In other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, 
how they can be combined, and what their combinations mean.

这一部分描述Lua语言的词法、语法和语义。
换句话说，即哪些词法单词（token）是合法的、它们是怎样组合的、以及它们组合的含义。

Language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation, 
in which `{a}` means 0 or more `a`'s, and `[a]` means an optional `a`. 
Non-terminals are shown like `non-terminal`, keywords are shown like **kword**, 
and other terminal symbols are shown like `"="`. 
The complete syntax of Lua can be found in §9 at the end of this manual.

语言结构通常用扩展BNF范式描述，其中`{a}`表示0个或多个`a`，`[a]`表示0个或1个`a`（表示可选）。
非终结符会表示成这样`non-terminal`，关键字会表示成**kword**，而终结符号会表示成`"="`。
完整Lua语法列表可查看本手册结尾部分的§9。

## 3.1 Lexical Conventions

Lua is a free-form language. It ignores spaces (including new lines) and comments between lexical elements (tokens), except as delimiters between names and keywords.

Lua是一种形式自由的语言。它忽略包含换行符在内的任何多余空白和注释。

Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, 
digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit. 
Identifiers are used to name variables, table fields, and labels.

Lua中的名字（也叫标识符）可以是任何由字母、数字、下划线组成的字符串，只是不能以数字开头。
另外，下面列出的保留关键字也不能用作标识符。

The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:
```
and       break     do        else      elseif    end
false     for       function  goto      if        in
local     nil       not       or        repeat    return
then      true      until     while
```

Lua is a case-sensitive language: `and` is a reserved word, but `And` and `AND` are two different, valid names. 
As a convention, programs should avoid creating names that start with an underscore 
followed by one or more uppercase letters (such as `_VERSION`).

Lua是大小写敏感的语言: `and`是保留的关键字，但是`And`和`AND`则是可以使用的有效标识符。
另外，程序中应避免使用下划线开始，后跟一个或多个大写字母的名字（如`_VERSION`)。
以下列出的字符串是其他一些词法单词（token）。

The following strings denote other tokens:
```
+     -     *     /     %     ^     #
&     ~     |     <<    >>    //
==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =
(     )     {     }     [     ]     ::
;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
```

Literal strings can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, 
and can contain the following C-like escape sequences: `'\a'` (bell), `'\b'` (backspace), `'\f'` (form feed), 
`'\n'` (newline), `'\r'` (carriage return), `'\t'` (horizontal tab), `'\v'` (vertical tab), `'\\'` (backslash), 
`'\"'` (quotation mark [double quote]), and `'\''` (apostrophe [single quote]). 
A backslash followed by a real newline results in a newline in the string. 
The escape sequence `'\z'` skips the following span of white-space characters, including line breaks; 
it is particularly useful to break and indent a long literal string 
into multiple lines without adding the newlines and spaces into the string contents.

Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which can be specified as `'\0'`. 
More generally, we can specify any byte in a literal string by its numeric value. 
This can be done with the escape sequence `\xXX`, where `XX` is a sequence of exactly two hexadecimal digits, 
or with the escape sequence `\ddd`, where ddd is a sequence of up to three decimal digits. 
(Note that if a decimal escape sequence is to be followed by a digit, 
it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)

The UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode character can be inserted in a literal string 
with the escape sequence `\u{XXX}` (note the mandatory enclosing brackets), 
where `XXX` is a sequence of one or more hexadecimal digits representing the character code point.

Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long brackets. 
We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square bracket 
followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket. 
So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as `[[`, 
an opening long bracket of level 1 is written as `[=[`, and so on. 
A closing long bracket is defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written as `]====]`. 
A long literal starts with an opening long bracket of any level 
and ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. 
It can contain any text except a closing bracket of the same level. 
Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, 
and ignore long brackets of any other level. 
Any kind of end-of-line sequence (carriage return, newline, carriage return followed by newline, 
or newline followed by carriage return) is converted to a simple newline.

Any byte in a literal string not explicitly affected by the previous rules represents itself. 
However, Lua opens files for parsing in text mode, 
and the system file functions may have problems with some control characters. 
So, it is safer to represent non-text data as a quoted literal with explicit escape sequences for non-text characters.

For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline, 
the newline is not included in the string. As an example, 
in a system using ASCII (in which `'a'` is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and `'1'` is coded as 49), 
the five literal strings below denote the same string:
```
a = 'alo\n123"'
a = "alo\n123\""
a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
a = [[alo
123"]]
a = [==[
alo
123"]==]
```

A numeric constant (or numeral) can be written with an optional fractional part and an optional decimal exponent, 
marked by a letter `'e'` or `'E'`. 
Lua also accepts hexadecimal constants, which start with `0x` or `0X`. 
Hexadecimal constants also accept an optional fractional part plus an optional binary exponent, 
marked by a letter `'p'` or `'P'`. 
A numeric constant with a fractional dot or an exponent denotes a float; otherwise it denotes an integer. 

Examples of valid integer constants are:
```
3   345   0xff   0xBEBADA
```

Examples of valid float constants are:
```
3.0     3.1416     314.16e-2     0.31416E1     34e1
0x0.1E  0xA23p-4   0X1.921FB54442D18P+1
```

A comment starts with a double hyphen (`--`) anywhere outside a string. 
If the text immediately after `--` is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a short comment, 
which runs until the end of the line. 
Otherwise, it is a long comment, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. 
Long comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.
