**load (chunk [, chunkname [, mode [, env]]])**

Loads a chunk. If chunk is a string, the `chunk` is this string. 
If `chunk` is a function, `load` calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. 
Each call to chunk must return a string that concatenates with previous results. 
A return of an empty string, `nil`, or no value signals the end of the chunk.

If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; 
otherwise, returns `nil` plus the error message.

If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value of `env`, 
if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global environment. 
Other upvalues are initialized with `nil`. 
(When you load a main chunk, the resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue, 
the `_ENV` variable (see ยง2.2).
However, when you load a binary chunk created from a function (see `string.dump`), 
the resulting function can have an arbitrary number of upvalues.) 
All upvalues are fresh, that is, they are not shared with any other function.

`chunkname` is used as the name of the chunk for error messages and debug information (see ยง4.9). 
When absent, it defaults to chunk if chunk is a string, or to `"=(load)"` otherwise.

The string `mode` controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is, a precompiled chunk). 
It may be the string `"b"` (only binary chunks), `"t"` (only text chunks), or `"bt"` (both binary and text). 
The default is `"bt"`.

Lua does not check the consistency of binary chunks. 
Maliciously crafted binary chunks can crash the interpreter.

**loadfile ([filename [, mode [, env]]])**

Similar to `load`, but gets the chunk from file filename or from the standard input, if no file name is given.
