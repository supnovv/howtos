## uiautomatorviewer

The uiautomatorviewer tool provides a convenient GUI to scan and analyze the UI components currently displayed on an Android device. You can use this tool to inspect the layout hierarchy and view the properties of UI components that are visible on the foreground of the device. This information lets you create more fine-grained tests using UI Automator, for example by creating a UI selector that matches a specific visible property.
The uiautomatorviewer tool is located in the `<android-sdk>/tools/` directory.
