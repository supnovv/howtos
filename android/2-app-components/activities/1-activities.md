# Activities

An Activity is an application component that provides a screen 
with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, 
take a photo, send an email, or view a map. 
Each activity is given a window in which to draw its user interface. 
The window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows.
