什么是第一推动
几百年修得你一次回眸，这几百年到底在修些什么
回眸一笑百媚生 一笑泯恩仇 到底在说什么
歪脖读书
摸索一条持续有效的读书方法来

诗歌的游戏：一个原则，两个重点
一个原则：不要在意规则，自由自在发挥想象，把写诗当作一种游戏。
两个重点：第一要开放，第二是答案越多越好。
玩游戏的两个方法：第一个方法，自问自答。比如：树是什么？把所有答案都写下来。当写下足够
多的事物后，在深入一层在这些想到的事物上继续提问，是什么，有什么，跟树到底有什么关系，
能干什么，能怎么样，无限扩展你的想象空间。
第二个方法，罗列出各种事物，然后再用一个动词组合起来，比如草帽想念阳光，杯子想念冰块。

What are you doing hiding out here, girl?
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't get asked to the dance.
It's all right.
Some things we just got to keep to ourselves, right?
All the boys say i'm ugly.
Mama was third runner-up in the Miss South Carolina pageant.
I wish you'd quit feeling sorry for yourself. Now, that's ugly.
Ugly is something that goes up inside you.
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.
Now you're not one of them, is you?
I didn't think so, honey.
Every day.. Every day you're not dead in the ground.
When you wake up in the morning, you're gonna have to make some deicisions.
Got to ask yourself this question: Am I gonna believe all them bad things
them fools say about me today?
You hear me?
Am I gonna believe all them bad things them fools say about me today?
All right?
As for your mama, she didn't pick her life. It picked her.
But you.. you're gonna do something big with yours.
You wait and see.
Come on, go home with me till the dance over. Come on.
